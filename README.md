Decision Requirements Analysis on Customer Loyalty Programs
----------------

This project involves using DecisionsFirst software to frame the decision making process for a retail company regarding its customer loyalty program.  My goal is to create a Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD) that focuses on determining which reward to offer a customer.  In my analysis, I break down the factors that contribute towards making this decision--such as sub-decisions, requirements for each decision, and policies that dictate each decision.  Finally, I propose solutions on how to maximize the effectiveness of my organization's customer loyalty program.

The full report can be found in the file "Decision Framing.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, decision framing, sub-decisions, requirements, policies and regulations, program effectiveness, and proposed solutions.  An image of my Decision Requirements Diagram, as well as a breakdown of each decision, are included in the appendix.

The DRD used in this project is located in the file "Decision Requirements.xml".  This file requires DecisionsFirst software in order to be used correctly.
